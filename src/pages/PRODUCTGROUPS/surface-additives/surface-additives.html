          <p>During the application of liquid coatings on surfaces a multitude of surface defects can occur. The cause for this is, among others, significantly differing surface tensions. If, for example, the surface tension of the coating is higher than that of the substrate, this manifests itself in poor wetting (high contact angle) and, with that poor adhesion and cratering. Also after the application and while the coating is drying, local surface tension differences can cause unfavorable leveling and the floating of pigments. BYK offers a variety of additives which can improve or even prevent these surface defects.</p>
          <p>In addition, additives from this product class can also influence the surface slip and increase the cleanability.</p>
